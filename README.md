ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, I'm Sameed**

I'm currently a Financial Analyst in the Finance and Operations team at Reggora. I like working on various different projects on topics that interest me with Excel, SQL, and Tableau. I am most passionate and interested in SQL as my first projects on Github were completed with MySQL as well. I've self-learned SQL, Tableau, and Excel through Codecademy, Treehouse, and DataCamp. I'm currently learning Python for data analysis.

Originally I am from San Jose, CA where I was born and raised. I hold a BS in Business Administration from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley.

Outside of work, I like playing Roller Hockey, practicing Archery, going Horseback Riding, and working out.

I'm also into self-development books and like learning about spoken languages and history. Currently I'm learning German.
